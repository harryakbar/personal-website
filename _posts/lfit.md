Yo, this is the series of Love For Imperfect Things book review and opinion about part of it, and this the part 1:

### Self Care

Here we are in the earth as an individual unique human, we also need to treat ourselves first and not always should to praised to be “good” by help all people. It’s okay to be different with other people, so be good to ourselves first, then other people.

From my perspective as a reader, I 100% agree with this part to care to myself first. And I also realized recently that I actually really praised to be a “good person” for other people, but yeah I also have purpose of my life in the future and I don’t need to think what other people think about my goals. Back then, I met a person that underestimate and think that my goals is not as great with this person’s family that very rich, but yup being rich, have degree at elite world-class university, have good status or whatever it is not my purpose.

I rather to choose to be a great contributor in the society to help and grow other people in a large scale with my skills and knowledge that I wish always grow each day. There are a lot of contribution field that available for young person like me. I really interested with the education, logistics, and also health sector, I wish I can give my big contribution in there, because I feel fulfilled when I can share with other and unblock society problem, idk why but it just make me have peaceful mind.

I really grateful as a software engineer now. I think it has possibility to allow me to pursue my goals. So yeah, be kind for yourself first and world will also find you worthy of care.

Favorites quotes from this Self Care part:

```
If we examine what motivates us, we see that even as adults we want recognitions from other people, and that so much of what we do comes from that desire to be recognized. Shower you child with attention, and make her feel secure in your love. This way she won’t grow up starved for other people’s acknowledgement.

If you begin to believe what others say about you, they will begin to control you. Not everything that appears in your mind is true. Do not let someone else’s opinion rule your life.
```
